# Laravel Model Respositories
Wraps around [Eloquent models](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent) allowing them to be used as repositories. 

## Why?
Because getting a collection from a model "object" isn't really a models
role, and is deceptive when injecting a model and using it in another context
